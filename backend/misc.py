### for things i dont know where to put


# ISSUES : if user skip a song and then listen it once complete, one the 1st listen it will mark as 1 star but then he listen again so it will marked as repeated song and hence getting 5 star
# fix :  to use a percentage and priority system, lets say 1st listen was 1 star and 2nd time is 4 instead of giving it 5 stars get it avg of 1 and 4 star , also by prioriting when the song was listened,
# if song was listend 4 days ago get it less percentage,

# TODO : Add an option to update playlist from stars , plan is to get the song, and there stars, and use value defined by user to mark them as skip partial, complete and repeat


# # redo star sytem, lets instead of just writing the star on one intraction lets do in more intearactions like 2 or 3 and prioriting recent
# - take 2 or more intreaction as minimum to star
# - priorities recent interactions
# - decay to deplete  0.1 ^ days
# - add a buffer to check repeat, if a song is listen 2 times in 20 min then consider it a repeat
# - dont take data if its older then 2 months,
