#  TuneLog
**A self-hosted music recommendation system for Navidrome.** TuneLog learns your taste by watching how you actually interact with your music tracking skips, finishes, and replays to build evolving, personalized playlists without you ever touching a "Like" button.

---

##  Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
* **Navidrome** instance (Running and accessible via API).
* **Docker & Docker Compose** (Recommended) OR **Python 3.10+**.
* A Navidrome client that supports scrobbling/Now Playing reporting.

### 2. Installation (Docker - Recommended)
>  **Critical:** Docker and manual runs (`python main.py`) are mutually exclusive. Docker marks the `data/` folder as `rootowned`. If you switch between them, run `sudo chown -R $USER:$USER data/` to fix permissions.

### DOCKER
- This will create two containers, use manual way if you dont want that

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adiiverma40/tunelog
cd tunelog

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Navidrome URL and Admin credentials
```

**Launch the stack:**
```bash
docker compose up --build
```
* **Web UI:** `http://localhost:5173`
* **API Server:** `http://localhost:8000`

---

### Manual
- Use this if you dont want to run two containers

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adiiverma40/tunelog
cd tunelog
```
- Backend
```bash
cd backend

pip install -r requirements.txt

python3 main.py
```
- Frontend
```bash
cd frontend

npm install 

npm run dev
```

### .env
```bash
#Navidrome
#base_url = navidrome ip 
# base_url = http://192.168.29.118:4533 # THIS IS MINE IP ADDRESS

# Admin and password
admin_username = username # (username used while creating navidrome account )
admin_password = password # (Password used while creating navidrome account)

# vite api url 

# VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
# VITE_API_URL=http://192.168.29.118:8000 # THIS IS MINE 

```
- You can get your ip address by doing, `ipconfig` in windows and `ip a` in linux or use `localhost` if its works for you


## How It Works
TuneLog uses **Implicit Feedback**. Instead of manual ratings, it watches "Signals" via the Navidrome SSE (Server-Sent Events) stream to judge your interest.

### The Signal System
- Can Be changed

| Behavior | Signal | Weight | Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Skipped < 30%** | `skip` | -5 | Heavy penalty; removes from high-rotation. |
| **Played 30–80%** | `partial` | +1 | Interest shown; kept in "Discovery" rotation. |
| **Played 80–100%** | `positive` | +2 | Solid interest; increases playlist frequency. |
| **Replayed < 24h** | `repeat` | +3 | Highest signal; moves to "Heavy Rotation." |

### Smart Playlist Generation 
- Can be changed from DashBoard
* TuneLog manages a balanced "Diet" of music across several slots:
* **Scored Songs:** Ranked by (Signal Weight × Recency Decay). Yesterday's favorite counts more than last year's.
* **Genre Injection:** Scans for unheard songs in your top genres (e.g., Bollywood, Rap) and injects them as discoveries.
* **Wildcards:** Resurrects "Lost Favorites" you haven't heard in 60+ days.
* **Second Chances:** Occasional re-exposure to "Skips" (configurable via UI) to account for changing moods.

### **Auto Genre Match**
Added a option to match genre automatically, this is needed for better genre injection of songs, if there is a messy genre in db, song recommended becomes in accurate.
- Currently there is no option for multiple genre like `rap, hip hop`
- you can create a category genre and map noisy genre in it,
- The Auto match features take the noisy genre and its data and matches it against genre in db, the one with heightest score gets added in Genre.json file
- you can get a sample genre from `architecture.md`
- If there is data in genre.json, when doing library sync, it will automatically change the matching genre to the category genre

---

### **CSV IMPORT**
Added a option to import playlist from csv files, you can download csv for spotify from [Exportify](https://exportify.net/).
- Currently I dont know how it works, My library has limited songs and Messy meta data, so I am getting matching results of 14 songs out of 50
- I havent tested with other csv file. But I think it can handle other files as well, as long as it have Title, artist name and album name
- For workings read `Architecture.md`

### **ERROR HANDLING**
Added better error handling, i took some help from ai
- `error.py` is now the entry point
- Using Supervisor pattern to ensure it dont crash when navidrome is down
- it will exit if `port 8000` is taken
- if `port  5173` is taken
- uses a heartbeat mechanism
For more info read architecture.md


## Roadmap & TODO

- [] **Notification Bridge:** Real-time "Now Playing" popups on the React Dashboard.
- [] **Rnadom Song Toggle:** Add a Better toggle to turn of random song integration in playlist
