# TuneLog
A lightweight, self-hosted music recommendation system that learns your taste from how you actually listen — no ratings, no manual input.


# 🤖 AI Usage

This project was built by me, with AI assistance in specific areas:

- **SQL queries** — helped write and optimise some of the SQLite queries
- **Boilerplate code** — repetitive setup code like DB connection handlers and URL builders
- **Documentation** — README formatting and wording

The core logic — signal system, scoring formula, genre injection, playlist slot system, and architecture decisions — was designed and written by me.

## TODO: 
- Add a better api system for search excilit tag of songs,
   I have some ideas how to do it,
  currently in my songlist db in excilipt col there is notinitunes in some song, thats becuase some of the songs has noisy title ig : DJ Alok Main aur tu remix, these makes itunes to return wrong info
  My idea is to make api requests to itunes in trail and error, try dj alok, try alok main  , try mai or tu, and use fuzzy module to get the closest to the reposne and use that, this will take time so make it automatic at a specify time i.g, 1 Am

- Give users option to choose the amount of signal they want in the playlist by how much, right now its hardcoded but it can be added, but the playlist.py will change a lot, there is so many edge cases to handle in for that option, what if the amount of singal is less then why users wants, but it will a good feature to have, - for future

- Improve the genre injection by using a dynamic multiplier, for songs that are listened more it will have more multiplier, this will replace hardcoded GENERE_ALIESE, for users not myself, i listen to bollywood so I can hardcode it but for more users, hardcoding thousands of it is useless 

- Use pre existing notication of the ui to show the notification of which user is playing which song, when song change send data to frontend and then use that to show notification.

- Use stars to import in database, if user have already started some song then use it to import in the database to remove cold start problem

- Add, "Add to database only" option in user adding menu


## ISSUES :
- Currently i havent how well this project work with Symfonium app, as it uses caching and i need live data of skips to work, other options works well(I think) - if you know let me know 
- Doing fast sync only added half of the songs from playlist , do fast sync multiple times to get all songs, same for slow sync
- if making playlist for the 1st time, and havent slow sync even once, check the All option from exicilpt filter
- For some reasons, the no. of songs after appending is not right in ui, its all correct in the navidrome
- I havent cleaned up the og code of ui so in some cases you will see tailwind, ig., in using ui in phone
- IF YOU RAN IT BY DOCKER DO NOT RAN WITH MANUAL (`python main.py`) , DOCKER MARKS THE DATA FILE AS ITS ROOT AND python WILL NOT BE ABLE TO WRITE IN IT

## How It Works
TuneLog watches your Navidrome listening activity in the background. It tracks whether you skip, finish, or replay songs, and uses that behavior to build personalised playlists automatically — one per user.

| Listening Behavior | Signal | Weight |
|---|---|---|
| Skipped before 30% | skip | -2 |
| Played 30–80% | partial | +1 |
| Played to end | positive | +2 |
| Replayed after 10 min | repeat | +3 |

Scores are weighted by recency — a listen from yesterday counts more than one from 3 months ago.

Generated playlists include:
- **Scored songs** — ranked by signal weight × recency
- **Genre-injected unheard songs** — new songs from genres you already listen to
- **Wildcards** — songs you liked but haven't heard in 60+ days
- **Skip re-exposure** — occasional re-surfacing of skipped songs (tastes change)

## Stack
- **Navidrome** — self-hosted music server (Subsonic API)
- **Python** — watcher + playlist generator
- **SQLite** — two local databases (listen history + full library)
- **FastAPI** — REST API layer (early stage)
- **React + TypeScript + Vite** — web dashboard (early stage, TailAdmin base)

## Multi User

Users can be added directly from the TuneLog web dashboard — no manual config editing needed.

1. Open the web UI at **http://localhost:5173/**
2. Go to **Users** from the sidebar
3. Fill in the username and password — TuneLog will create the user in Navidrome and register them automatically

> If you're running via Docker, replace `localhost` with your server's IP address.



## Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- Navidrome instance (local or remote)
- Docker (optional, recommended for Navidrome)

## Setup

> ⚠️ **Note:** Docker and manual (`python main.py`) runs are mutually exclusive.
> Docker marks the `data/` folder as root-owned, so Python cannot write to it outside the container.
> Run one or the other — not both.


### Web UI (early stage — work in progress)

> ⚠️ The web dashboard is in early development. Data is connected but UI still needs significant polishing. Not production-ready.

Dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:5173`. Requires the API server running on port 8000.

---

### Docker (recommended)

**1. Clone the repo**

**2. Configure your environment**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Navidrome URL, credentials, etc.
```
**3. Run**
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### Manual
> **Note:** if you have run docker before dont do this, docker marks data folder as root and will not be to write in dabase using this method

**1. Clone the repo**

**2. Start the API server**
```bash
cd backend
pip install fastapi uvicorn
uvicorn api:app --reload --port 8000
```

**3. Start the frontend**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```


**4. Configure your environment**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Navidrome URL, credentials, etc.
```
**5. Install dependencies**
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**6. Configure `.env`**
```env
BASE_URL=http://your-navidrome-ip:4533
ADMIN_USERNAME=your_admin_username
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_admin_password


# API
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
# VITE_API_URL=http://backend:8000  ← use this when running via Docker
```

**7. Run**
```bash
python main.py
```

> **Note:** If you are using a Navidrome client, turn on the scrobbling feature or it will not report back.

TuneLog will:
- Start watching what's playing in real time via SSE
- Log listen history to SQLite
- Automatically regenerate personalised playlists every hour (when no one is playing)

## Playlist Generation
Playlists are pushed directly to Navidrome and appear under each user's account as **"Tunelog - username"**. They are private — only visible to the playlist owner.

| Slot | Share | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Unheard (genre-filtered) | up to 35% | shrinks as library gets explored |
| Positive | ~20% | songs you finished |
| Repeat | ~20% | songs you came back to |
| Partial | ~12% | songs worth another chance |
| Wildcard | ~8% | good songs not heard in 60+ days |
| Skip | ~5% | rare re-exposure |

## Why TuneLog?
Most self-hosted music servers either have no recommendations or rely on external APIs like Last.fm. TuneLog is fully offline, stores everything locally, and is built around implicit feedback — your listening behaviour is the only input needed.

---
> Built for Navidrome. Inspired by how early Last.fm and Spotify worked before they had millions of users.
